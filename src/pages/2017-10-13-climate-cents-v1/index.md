### Climate Cents 1.0.1
At last, a full releast of v1 of Climate Cents and a return to blogging after a year off.

I blame the 2016 election. The fallout and emotion soaked up all my bandwidth.

Anyways, here it is, Climate Cents.

And here is the repo.

### FutureStuff

The next version (1.1.0) out very soon will feature a challenges section that has teams competing to raise the most money for a specific challenge in a hat tip to Movember and kids running in circles around school yards for charity.

I have also started using the Github projects section to guide contributors (me) for next steps. I would like to see 1.2.0 be more of a generic crowdfunding platform that anyone can use and brand as they see fit.
