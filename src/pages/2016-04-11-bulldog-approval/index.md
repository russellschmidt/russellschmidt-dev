For all of those millions of Amazon Echo users out there, my first skill has been approved and is certified available on for the Echo. 'Fun Bulldog Facts' is going to take the world by storm so brace yourself. It tells you a random bulldog fact, with about 100 facts saved for your pleasure.

This is my greatest moment of programming triumph to date.

I know it is just a silly, fun application, but I am still inordinately proud of it.
