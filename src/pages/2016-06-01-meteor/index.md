## Meteor it is.
GameTree is a project I am assisting with and they have decided to use the following stack:

1. Meteor
2. Jade for HTML syntax
3. SASS for CSS Preprocessing
4. CoffeeScript for JavaScript
5. Foundation for a front-end framework
6. MongoDB for the database (non-optional with Meteor)

Of these 5 things, I have worked with SASS and Foundation before. So, I have my work cut out for me.

### Meaty Yore
I heard of Meteor on a [Code Newbie podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/meteor) while on my VisionQuest 2015 road trip when I was debating making the big jump to a new career.  It sounded awesome but at the time my JS skills were not all that sharp. Well fast-forward to today and here I am, about to embark on some Meteor goodness with a decent sized Dev team.

### Mongo Like
Some things to know right off the bat: MongoDB uses different vocabulary than the SQL gang.

|SQL | Mongo|
|---|---|
|table | collection |
|row | document|
|column | field |

The only one I have trouble understanding is document for row.
