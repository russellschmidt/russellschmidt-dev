Always nice to see something working out of the box.

Big ups shout out mad respect honor from most high Jah Rastafari to this excellent resource [Creating a Blog with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/) by Dustin Schau.

All previous posts have been migrated over from my old Jekyll blog.

I love you.
